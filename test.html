            How do you create and switch between branches in Git, and what is the purpose of branching
        </article>
        <article class="response">
            To create a branch in git you need to use the command "git branch (branch's name)". <br>
            To switch between branches you need to use the command "git switch (name of the branch you want to switch to)". <br>
            In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or 
            fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.
